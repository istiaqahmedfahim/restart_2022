# Stacking Model Notebook

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning stacking approach for classification tasks. It includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The stacking method combines multiple base models to improve predictive performance.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess data for machine learning.
- **Custom Evaluation Functions**: Includes functions to generate and visualize confusion matrices.
- **Model Training**: Train base classifiers and a meta-classifier using a stacking approach.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate models using standard metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
